Loading Quest
=============

Loading Quest is a the ultimate loading widget for web applications that have long processing requests.
It is a role playing video game 100% without controls. Thanks to this, Loading Quest is the only video
game that can really be used by anyone: a 2-months baby, your dog or even your boss.

[Test it here.](/loadingquest.html)

Loading Quest is a fork of Progress Quest by Eric Fredricksen. It is licensed under the terms of the MIT
license.

Using Loading Quest on your own web site
----------------------------------------

Start by [downloading it here](/loadingquest.zip).

Loading quest is just a Javascript library with Jquery and Jquery-ui as dependencies plus a css
file. All those files are provided in the zip file. Example of html code to load those files:

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="loadingquest.css" />

    <script src="jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="jquery-ui.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="loadingquest.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

To start the animation, use this code:

    loadingquest.launch();

If you want to stop the animation (although I don't understand why you would want to
do such a thing), you can use the following code:

    loadingquest.stop();
