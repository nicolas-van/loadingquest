Loading Quest
=============

Loading Quest is the ultimate loading widget for web applications that have long processing requests. It displays a
role playing video game 100% without controls.

Your character is automatically created. He pursues quests, kills monsters and levels up by himself. Thanks to this,
Loading Quest is the only video game that can really be used by anyone: a 2-months baby, a dog or even your boss. Of
course you character is also automatically saved. So the next time you will have to wait you will be happy to get back
your character and seek for new adventures!

[Test it here.](/loadingquest.html)

Loading Quest is a fork of Progress Quest by Eric Fredricksen. It is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.

Using Loading Quest on your own web site
----------------------------------------

Start by [downloading it here](/loadingquest.zip).

Loading quest is just a Javascript library with Jquery and Jquery-ui as dependencies plus a css file. All those files
are provided in the zip file. Example of html code to load those files:

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="loadingquest.css" />

    <script src="jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="jquery-ui.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="loadingquest.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

To start the animation, use this code:

    loadingquest.launch();

If you want to stop the animation (although I don't understand why you would want to do such a thing), you can use the
following code:

    loadingquest.stop();
